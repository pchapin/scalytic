  <title>Building Scalytic</title>

  <para>This chapter describes how to build Scalytic and its associated documentation. We also
    describe various issues related to the tool chain in general, such as setting up a
    continuous integration server and the use of style tools. This chapter is intended for
    Scalytic contributors or for power users who wish to build the system from the source code
    repository. If you are using a binary distribution you can skip this section
    entirely.</para>

  <para>The tools with specific version numbers shown below are the official tools used by the
    Scalytic contributors. Other tools (or other versions of the same tools) may also work.
    Obviously the greater the differences between the tools you attempt to use and those listed
    below the more problems you are likely to encounter.</para>

  <para>Scalytic uses a number of libraries. Some of the these libraries are included in the
    Scalytic repository. You do not need to download and install them yourself. Consequently
    those libraries are not mentioned here. The section only contains tools and libraries that
    you need to set up manually. Be aware, however, that the libraries included in the Scalytic
    repository do not include their documentation. You may wish to download that documentation
    from each library vendor's web site.</para>

        <para>We use JDK v1.7.0_51 but any 1.7 version would probably work. A full JDK is
          necessary, and not just a JRE, because the Augusta code base includes some Java
          files.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>We use IntelliJ IDEA, Community Edition, v13.0.2 with the IntelliJ Scala plugin
          developed by JetBrains as our integrated development environment. The plugin can be
          installed from inside IntelliJ once the main IDE is installed.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>We use Scala v2.10.3. The Scala compiler is executed indirectly via IntelliJ.
          Currently no official method of building Augusta outside the IDE is provided.
            <emphasis>TODO: A method to build Augusta using ant, maven, or SBT would be
            useful.</emphasis></para>

      <term><ulink url="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</ulink></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The documentation is written primarily in DocBook. This is an XML format and so is
          readable (and writable) in an ordinary text editor. However, if you want to build
          nicely formatted documentation or benefit from a more advanced editing features, you
          will need a tool chain for processing DocBook documents. Several such tool chains
          exist. DocBook is supported in IntelliJ but we currently use <ulink
            url="http://oxygenxml.com/">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</ulink> as our primary DocBook editing
          and formatting tool. Emacs's nXML mode is also useful. <emphasis>TODO: Describe a
            DocBook tool chain in more detail or how to set up IntelliJ for DocBook
            editing.</emphasis></para>

        <para>We use Jenkins as our continuous integration system. Our practice is to run
          Jenkins from the <ulink url="http://glassfish.java.net/">Glassfish</ulink> application
          server. <emphasis>TODO: Give more details about setting up Glassfish and
            Jenkins.</emphasis></para>

  <para>To build Scalytic, first install the Scalytic software prerequisites above, and the
    libraries mentioned in the lib folder's README file. You will have to set up your JDK in
    IntelliJ and define two "external libraries" for Scala. The Scalytic project files assume
    these libraries are named "scala-compiler-2.10" and "scala-library-2.10."</para>

  <para>You can then use IntelliJ's integrated Git support to check out the Scalytic project
    from <ulink url="https://github.com/pchapin/scalytic.git"/>. Once you have the project
    loaded into IntelliJ build the full project.</para>

  <para><emphasis>TODO: Say something about testing!</emphasis></para>
