Scalytic
========

This folder contains a Scala analysis tool, currently implemented as a compiler plugin. The
scope of the analysis done by Scalytic is currently open (and largely undefined).  The
motivation for creating such a tool comes from my experience with Ada and SPARK where powerful
static analysis is a respected part of the culture. How much of that kind of analysis can be
applied to Scala is unclear; I regard it as a research question. Scalytic is thus a research
project.
